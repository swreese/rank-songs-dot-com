  <!-- FAQ list -->
  <details open>
    <summary>#1 Who created this site and why these artists?</summary>
    <div class="answer">
      RankSongs was created by Steven, a long-time fan of Jack Johnson and positive, family-friendly music across genres.
      The first artists reflect music he and his family enjoy—talented performers with generally clean messages that fans of all ages can listen to.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>#2 Why can I only rank a Top 20?</summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Twenty hits the sweet spot. Top 10 is often too short; Top 25 can be overwhelming.
      A Top 20 list is challenging but doable—and easier to compare across fans.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>#3 Will other artists be added? Can I recommend one?</summary>
    <div class="answer">
      We may add more artists over time. For now we’re focused on the featured five.
      Suggest an artist by emailing <a href="mailto:info.ranksongs@gmail.com">info.ranksongs@gmail.com</a>.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>#4 How are the Global Rankings calculated?</summary>
    <div class="answer">
      To keep results stable, we use a Bayesian weighted average.
      Each ranking gives 20 points to #1 down to 1 point for #20.<br><br>
      <strong>Raw Score</strong> = ((PRIOR_COUNT × PRIOR_AVG) + (timesRanked × avgRank)) ÷ (PRIOR_COUNT + timesRanked)<br>
      <strong>Composite Score</strong> = 21 − Raw Score (higher is better).<br><br>
      This rewards songs that are both highly ranked and frequently ranked, while still letting new songs climb as votes come in.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>#5 How often can I vote?</summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Please submit rankings no more than once every 90 days. This keeps the leaderboard fair without requiring logins.
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>#6 Any tips for building my list?</summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Start with the songs you know belong in your Top 15. Fill the rest with favorites that matter to you.
      Then nudge tracks up or down using the arrows. Consider replay value, personal impact, classics, and popularity—have fun!
